# Grocery-Delivery-Final
Download the Final Project Folder to your computer. 
Once downloaded, open the folder and find the file labeled "Home.html" and click on that file.
This will take you directly to the home page of the website where you can navigate through the different tabs and webpages.
For the purpose of this project, the code for the 4 grocery stores displayed is identical.
The "quantity in stock" of each product is a randomly generated number and will update on every refresh of the webpage.
When creating an account, it displays a message once the submit button is clicked, but it does not save your information for the purpose of this project.
